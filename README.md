# PantherBuddy
This the implementation of my Advanced Software Engineering Project (Fall 2016) named "PantherBuddy" using : 
a) JSF 2.1 
b) EJB 3.1 
c) JPA 2

The main project here is "pantherbuddy" which will build all the other projects and update the ear.
The project "pantherbuddy-web" is the web project where all the frontend code is present.
The project "pantherbuddy-api" is the interface between "pantherbuddy-web" and "pantherbuddy-server"
The project "pantherbuddy-server" contains the application logic and server and database code.

The project uses MySQL as its backened database.
