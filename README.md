# PantherBuddy
This the implementation of my Advanced Software Engineering Project (Fall 2016) named "PantherBuddy" using : 

a) JSF 2.1 

b) EJB 3.1 

c) JPA 2

The main project here is "pantherbuddy" which will build all the other projects and update the ear.

The project "pantherbuddy-web" is the web project where all the frontend code is present.

The project "pantherbuddy-api" is the interface between "pantherbuddy-web" and "pantherbuddy-server".

The project "pantherbuddy-server" contains the application logic and server and database code.

The project "pantherbuddy-ear" is the ear for the project to be deployed.

The project uses MySQL as its backened database.

The project was configured to use JBoss Wildfly 8.2.1.
